<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Diverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic Cover Type</li><li>Manual Cover Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Explosion diverters come in two main types: Automatic Cover Type and Manual Cover Type. Automatic Cover Type diverters automatically detect and divert explosions through a cover that activates when pressure is detected. Manual Cover Type diverters require human intervention to manually cover the explosion in the event of a blast. Both types provide protection against explosions by redirecting the force away from critical areas, reducing the risk of damage and injury. Each type caters to different needs and preferences in explosion prevention and safety measures.</p></p>
