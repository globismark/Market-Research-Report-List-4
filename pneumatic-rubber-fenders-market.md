<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Rubber Fenders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Chain Type</li><li>Without Chain Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic rubber fenders are commonly divided into two types: with chain type and without chain type. The with chain type fenders have a steel chain running through the fender which provides additional strength and stability. On the other hand, the without chain type fenders do not have any chains and rely solely on the inflatable rubber body for impact absorption. Both types are effective in protecting ships and docks from collisions, with the chain type offering extra security.</p></p>
