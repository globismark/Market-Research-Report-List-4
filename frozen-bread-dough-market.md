<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Frozen Bread Dough Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fermented</li><li>Unfermented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Frozen bread dough is available in two main market types: fermented and unfermented. Fermented dough has gone through the process of fermentation, where yeast acts on sugars in the dough to create carbon dioxide gas, which causes it to rise. This results in a softer, more flavorful bread. On the other hand, unfermented dough has not gone through this process and may require longer baking times. Both types offer convenience and flexibility for consumers looking to easily bake fresh bread at home.</p></p>
