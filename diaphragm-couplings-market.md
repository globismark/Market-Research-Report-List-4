<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diaphragm Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Diaphragm</li><li>Double Diaphragm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diaphragm couplings are classified into two market types: Single Diaphragm and Double Diaphragm. Single Diaphragm couplings are designed with one diaphragm to transmit torque and compensate for misalignment. Meanwhile, Double Diaphragm couplings consist of two diaphragms connected by a spacer for increased torque capacity and flexibility in compensating for misalignment. Both types offer reliable and efficient power transmission in various industrial applications, with Double Diaphragm couplings being preferred for higher torque requirements.</p></p>
