<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poppet Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally-closed</li><li>Normally open</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Poppet solenoid valves are commonly classified into two types based on their default state of operation: normally-closed and normally-open. Normally-closed valves remain closed when the solenoid is not energized, and they open when an electrical current is applied. Conversely, normally-open valves are open when the solenoid is not energized, and they close when an electrical current is applied. Both types offer distinct advantages depending on the specific application requirements, providing flexibility and control in various fluid and gas systems.</p></p>
