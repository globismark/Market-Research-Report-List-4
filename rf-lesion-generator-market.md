<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RF Lesion Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Radio Frequency (RF)</li><li>Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The RF Lesion Generator market includes two main types: Conventional Radio Frequency (RF) and Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF). Conventional RF involves continuous energy delivery to create thermal lesions in tissues, commonly used for pain management therapies. In contrast, PRF delivers pulsed energy to target nerves without causing excessive heat buildup, offering a potentially safer and more precise treatment option for chronic pain conditions. Both technologies have their own advantages and applications depending on the specific medical needs of patients.</p></p>
