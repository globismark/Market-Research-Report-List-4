<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choke Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Through</li><li>Angled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Choke relief valves are available in two main types: straight through and angled. Straight through choke relief valves have a linear flow path, allowing for a direct passage of fluid without any abrupt changes in direction. Angled choke relief valves, on the other hand, have a bent or angled flow path, which can help with installation in tight or limited spaces. Both types of valves serve the same purpose of regulating pressure and preventing over-pressurization in a system.</p></p>
