<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3rd Generation EGFR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoclonal Antibody Class</li><li>Small Molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Third-generation EGFR inhibitors can be classified into monoclonal antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Monoclonal antibodies like osimertinib target specific proteins on cancer cells, blocking their growth. Small molecule TKIs such as rociletinib work by inhibiting enzymes that promote cancer cell proliferation. These drugs offer targeted therapy with fewer side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy, making them a promising option for patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.</p></p>
