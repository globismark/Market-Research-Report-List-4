<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid photoresist market can be categorized into two main types: Positive Photoresist and Negative Photoresist. Positive photoresist is a type of photoresist that becomes more soluble when exposed to ultraviolet light, making it ideal for creating patterns through a process of positive tone lithography. On the other hand, Negative photoresist becomes less soluble when exposed to ultraviolet light, allowing for the creation of patterns by protecting areas from light exposure. Both types of photoresists play a crucial role in the manufacturing of electronic components and microdevices.</p></p>
