<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Luffing Stackers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slewing</li><li>Non Slewing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Luffing stackers come in two main market types based on their movement capabilities: slewing and non-slewing. Slewing stackers can rotate around a central axis, offering greater flexibility and reach for stacking operations. They are ideal for handling materials in confined spaces or tight corners. On the other hand, non-slewing stackers have a fixed base and cannot rotate, making them more suitable for straightforward stacking tasks. Both types cater to different market needs and preferences for efficient material handling solutions.</p></p>
