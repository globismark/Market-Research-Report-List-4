<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Switching PTC Thermistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Heating Mode</li><li>Sensor Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Switching PTC Thermistors are used in two main market types: Self Heating Mode and Sensor Mode. In Self Heating Mode, the thermistor acts as a self-heating element that controls the circuit's temperature by switching it on and off as needed. This is commonly used in applications where temperature control is critical. In Sensor Mode, the thermistor acts as a sensor that detects changes in temperature and adjusts the circuit accordingly. This is commonly used in applications where precise temperature sensing is required.</p></p>
