<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sliding Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Sliding Bearing</li><li>Axial Sliding Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sliding bearings are classified into two main types: radial sliding bearings and axial sliding bearings. Radial sliding bearings are designed to support radial loads, which are perpendicular to the axis of the shaft, while axial sliding bearings support axial loads, which are parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial sliding bearings are commonly used in applications such as motors, fans, and pumps, while axial sliding bearings are used in thrust applications, such as gearboxes and transmissions. Both types of sliding bearings are essential components in machinery and equipment to ensure smooth and efficient operation.</p></p>
