<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydronic Floor Heating Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Above-floor Systems</li><li>Below-floor Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hydronic floor heating systems are classified into two main types: above-floor systems and below-floor systems. Above-floor systems involve installing pipes or tubing on top of a subfloor, which can be effective in retrofitting existing buildings. Below-floor systems, on the other hand, involve embedding the pipes or tubing within the concrete slab or subfloor, offering a more permanent and efficient heating solution. Both types of systems use water to heat the floor, providing a comfortable and consistent heating source for the building.</p></p>
